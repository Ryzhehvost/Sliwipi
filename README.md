# Sliwipi
Sliwipi is a browser extension that is supposed to drastically reduce browser stuttering when viewing someone's big Steam library or wishlist. It does that by splitting the long list of games into small pages.

# Known issues
Because of the way library and wishlist pages work with Sliwipi, Enhanced Steam can't work on these pages. Sliwipi tries to emulate some of the functionality provided by Enhanced Steam, such as sorting and filtering, removing items from wishlist without reloading the page, and total wishlist value, but not all Enhanced Steam's functions are implemented.
